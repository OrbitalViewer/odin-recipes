# Project: Recipes

## Foundations Course

### HTML Foundations

This project was about creating a recipes website using pure html. In doing so I have utilized most if not all skills taught so far in the Odin Project.

**Skills used:**

- Elements
- Basic html structure
- Paragraphs, strong tags, b tags, etc.
- Frankly too many lists
- An I also think I succeeded in writing decent commit messages

**Things I could improve on:**

- Im not sure but I think that maybe I should have committed slightly more often, for this project i basically committed once for each step of the project
  - I would need feedback to get a better idea
- The biggest thing is that I am lazy, I wrote the first recipe page entirely by hand, got annoyed and then used ChatGPT to generate the other two for completions sake.
  - Of course it would have been better practice to write the other two as well but as I said, I am lazy + I am somewhat pressed for time
