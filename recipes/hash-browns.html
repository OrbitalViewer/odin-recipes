        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          These homemade hash browns are <strong>crispy</strong> on the outside
          and <strong>tender</strong> on the inside â€” the perfect way to start
          your day. Made with just a few ingredients and a hot pan, they're
          simple to whip up and pair well with eggs, bacon, or anything you've
          got on the breakfast plate.
          <em>Best served hot and fresh off the pan.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Hash Browns - Step-by-Step</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><b>Grate the potatoes:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Use a box grater to shred the peeled potatoes (and onion if
                using).
              </li>
              <li>
                Place grated mixture in a bowl of cold water and let sit for a
                few minutes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Rinse and drain:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water until the water
                runs clear.
              </li>
              <li>This removes excess starch and helps them crisp up.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Dry the potatoes:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Place the grated potatoes in a clean towel and squeeze out as
                much moisture as possible.
              </li>
              <li>The drier they are, the crispier the result.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Cook the hash browns:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Heat oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spread the potatoes in a thin, even layer and press them down
                lightly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Let cook undisturbed for 4-5 minutes, until golden and crispy
                underneath.
              </li>
              <li>
                Flip and cook the other side for another 3-4 minutes until
                browned.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Season and serve:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
              <li>
                Serve hot with eggs, toast, or your favorite breakfast sides.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
